## Description:
Mobile first wireframe with responsive design, SMACSS organization, and jQuery.

This app will work with or without the JavaScript files.

#### Without JS:
* The site is responsive, and changes between two pre-set colorways for mobile or desktop
#### With JS & jQuery:
* The site is responsive, and assigns random colors to each page element each time the page width switches between the mobile and desktop views.
