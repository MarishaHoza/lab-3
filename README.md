### Feature #1: Responsive design
* As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.

1. Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
2. Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
3. Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
